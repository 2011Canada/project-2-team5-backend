# SPYBOOK

## Project Description
Spybook is a social game in which the main goal of the users, the players, is to hack other users.
The players can get contracts from the website and they specify who the target user is.
There is world map using which players can move between locations and find their targets.
Each user works by assuming a secret identity, an alias and each player can have multiple number of aliases.
Players level up or down based on the successful or unsuccesful completion of a contract.

## Getting Started

* Go to http://java-react-team5-project2.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ to get started.
OR
* Install any IDE(s) compatible with Java and JavaScript
* Download the backend and frontend code using the command $ `git clone https://github.com/2011Canada/project-2-team5-frontend.git` and `git clone https://github.com/2011Canada/project-2-team5-backend.git`
in bash and import the projects in the IDE.
* Backend:
    * update the maven project to install all dependencies
    * set the "ddl-auto" to "create" in the application.yml file in /src/main/resources
    * run the file Project2Application.java in src/main/java/com/revature/project2
    * set the "ddl-auto" back to "validate"
* Frontend:
    * On the command line, navigate to directory containing the cloned repo
    * run `npm install` to install all dependencies
    * run `npm start` to launch the website

## Usage

* On the login page, enter credentials to login as a player and you will be taken to the main page of the app where you can see options to travel between different locations and to hack a location.
* From the main page, go to the profile page to view all your aliases and your current alias. You will also find an option to create an alias there.
* Next, navigate to the contracts page to get a contract and come back to main page to begin hacking!
* You can go back to the profile page to check that the level of your alias has changed after a hack operation.
